1. This project is an experiment my take on event sourcing in F#.
2. Layers: **The core domain**: types and functions or methods operate according to the requirements in a functional way: object are immutable and functions or methods that operate on objects return the object changed according to the logic of the function/method

3. There is only one root level object representing a state.  that can be produced by applying eventst a state. The methods or functions that use it returning a new state are mirrored as  and A specific object is a root level object. It means that it references (contains) other objects so that each subobject is affected by at least on function or method.
4. The root objet needs a "empty" state, or zero state, or initial state. I defined this state by the static method GetEmpty().
5. The domain model methods that represent something that happens that return an instance of the object itself changed respect of the original object needs to be wrapped in a Event discriminated union type.
